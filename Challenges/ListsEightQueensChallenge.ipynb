Thus, it requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.  \n","\n","Given a placement of 8 queens on the chessboard. If there is a pair of queens that violates this rule, print YES, otherwise print NO. The input consists of eight coordinate pairs, one pair per line, with each pair giving the position of a queen on a standard chessboard with rows and columns numbered from 1 to 8.\n","\n","![eightqueens](http://i.imgur.com/yaxpgda.png)\n","\n","\n","\n","```\n","# Example input\n","1 5\n","2 3\n","3 1\n","4 7\n","5 2\n","6 8\n","7 6\n","8 4\n","\n","#Example output\n","NO\n","```\n","### Theory\n","If you don't know how to start solving this assignment, please, review a theory for this lesson:\n","https://snakify.org/lessons/lists/ \n","\n","You may also try step-by-step theory chunks:\n","https://snakify.org/lessons/lists/steps/1/\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab_type":"code","outputId":"74bf53c1-2492-433b-b65b-d113e346f199","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1580769720965,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":38172,"user":{"displayName":"Charles Vanchieri","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBauDRR6uSGBvI9oYit5cGU6T8SkJRV4CKiB98le2E=s64","userId":"02236610529346300368"}},"id":"gTpwg14JszhG","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":166}},"source":["x = []\n","y = []\n","for i in range(8):\n","  a = [int(s) for s in input().split()]\n","  x.append(a[0])\n","  y.append(a[1])\n","answer = 'NO'\n","for i in range(8):\n","  for j in range(i + 1, 8):\n","    if ((x[i] == x[j]) or\n","        (y[i] == y[j]) or\n","        (abs(x[i] - x[j]) == abs(y[i] - y[j]))):\n","      answer = 'YES'\n","print(answer)\n","# enter each input indivudally."],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["1 5 \n","2 3 \n","3 1 \n","4 7 \n","5 2 \n","6 8 \n","7 6 \n","8 4\n","NO\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
